# Daft
Daft is an exploratory toolbox of SAT/SMT and other automated logical reasoning techniques.

# Inspiration
Daft in the context of this project is taken to be an infatuation that is silly or foolish. The intent of this project is to explore concepts SAT/SMT and other automated logical reasoning techniques not necessarily to provide any industrial strength implementations. Daft is also an homage to the French electronic music duo Daft Punk whose "Discovery" and other albums have fueled many late-night hours of coding.
